The timestamp of the oldest key will determine how far back blockchain rescans need to begin for missing wallet transactions. "now" can be specified to bypass scanning, for keys which are known to never have been used, and 0 can be specified to scan the entire blockchain. Blocks up to 2 hours before the earliest key creation time of all keys being imported by the importmulti call will be scanned.
